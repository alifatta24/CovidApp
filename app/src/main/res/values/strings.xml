    <string name="newnews">  It has been more than two months since the first case of the virus was found on US soil. Since then
        there has been major change occuring in the United States. For instance, there have been millions of people losing their job.
        As a result there have been over 20 million people who have filed for unemployment. One reason for why there are
        so many unemployed people is because since people are not buying and the econmy has been decreasing, companies can not
        afford to keep as many employees as before. \n\n
        In the most recent update, President Donald Trump is allowing states to slowly reopen. The main reason for this
        decision is because of how negatively impacted our economy has been since the start of Covid-19.
